The Makefile will invoke f77 (which you can install on Ubuntu
by running "sudo apt-get install fort77") to compile McDonald's
data-munger, and then run the munger to convert the plain-text
ADVDAT into a binary file ADVTXT. Meanwhile, we compile "aamain.f"
and "asubs.f" into an executable called "adv551". At runtime,
the executable expects ADVTXT to appear in the current working
directory.

McDonald's original documentation (circa 1990) is in the file
"advent.doc" in this directory. The game itself contains the
version string <Generic Adventure 551 -- Version:6.6, August 1990>.

As McDonald explains, this is a port (from VAX Fortran to portable
Fortran 77) and allegedly very minor expansion of a 551-point
1985 VAX "Adventure" program, which itself was an expansion of
David Long's 500-point 1980 expansion of Crowther and Woods' game.
Long's 500-point game is for some reason version-numbered
"Adventure 5", and the anonymous VAX game is therefore numbered
"Adventure 6", as mentioned above. This is not to be confused with
David Platt's 550-point early-1980s expansion, sometimes referred
to as "Adventure 3", which exists on a completely disjoint branch
of the Adventure family tree. (For Platt's version, see the
directories PLAT0550/ and ODWY0550/.)

Unlike David Platt, who wrote in a domain-specific language he
called "A-code" and sacrificed several of the game's simulationist
aspects for the sake of ease-of-implementation, Long started with
Woods' original code and preserved much of it, right down to the
original copious comments.
