The Makefile will invoke f77 (which you can install on Ubuntu
by running "sudo apt-get install fort77") to compile McDonald's
data-munger, and then run the munger to convert the plain-text
ADVDAT into a binary file ADVTXT. Meanwhile, we compile "aamain.f"
and "asubs.f" into an executable called "adv551". At runtime,
the executable expects ADVTXT to appear in the current working
directory.

McDonald's original documentation (circa 1990) is in the file
"advent.doc" in this directory. The game itself contains the
version string <Generic Adventure 551 -- Version:6.6, August 1990>.

As McDonald explains, this is a port (from VAX Fortran to portable
Fortran 77) and very minor expansion of a 551-point 1985 VAX
"Adventure", which itself was an expansion of David Long's 500-point
1979 expansion. Long's 500-point game is for some reason
version-numbered "Adventure 5", and the anonymous VAX game is
therefore numbered "Adventure 6". This is not to be confused with
David Platt's 550-point early-1980s expansion, sometimes referred
to as "Adventure 3", which exists on a completely disjoint branch
of the Adventure family tree. (For Platt's version, see the
directories PLAT0550/ and ODWY0550/.)

Unlike David Platt, who wrote in a domain-specific language he
called "A-code" and sacrificed several of the game's simulationist
aspects for the sake of ease-of-implementation, Long started with
Woods' original code and preserved much of it, right down to the
original copious comments.

Compared to the original game, Long's 500-point version added
the Wumpus, elfin sword, River Styx, Alice puzzle, Altar,
Winery, natural bridge, Lost River Canyon, Flower Room, and
the combination safe in the Well House.

This 551-point version (dated "Version:6.6, August 1990") adds
a Castle of the Elves; a quartz sphere in the Crystal Palace;
and a star sapphire in the Star Chamber.  I believe these puzzles
are all due to an anonymous contributor circa 1984; McDonald
claims to have "added a small piece of game", but I'm not sure
to what he was referring.

There is another C port of MCDO0551, written by Robert R. Hall
(and dated "Version:7.0, July 1994") available online at
ftp://ftp.uni-duesseldorf.de/ftp/ftp/pub/unix/minix/1.7.1/src/src/commands/advent/

A 501(?)-point Fortran version (dated "Version:5.2/2, October-79",
posted to comp.sources.games in May 1990) is available at
http://cd.textfiles.com/gigagames9308/NET/USENET/VOLUME9/ADVEN
Unfortunately, this version is not F77-friendly.
It has no Castle of the Elves; its crystal ball is "opal", not
"quartz"; it has nothing in the Star Chamber at all (although a
comment refers to a "sapphire" anyway); and it adds a Haunted
Chamber to the north of the awkward canyon. The Haunted Chamber
leads to a "bizarre room" containing a magic word apparently
designed to bring the room's statues to life, but in Version 5.2/2
the word is unimplemented. Russel Dalenberg's Adventure Family
Tree refers to this version as "ANON0501".
