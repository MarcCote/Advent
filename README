This is a translation of Crowther and Woods' "Adventure" into
modern ANSI C. (Well, C89, actually.)

===========================================================================

A summary of existing versions and ports of Adventure is available
on Russel Dalenberg's website:
http://www.prismnet.com/~ged/www/advelist.html

  The original "Adventure" was written in Fortran IV by Will Crowther,
  and extended also in Fortran by Don Woods.

  In 1977, Jim Gillogly ported Woods' code to C. Gillogly's extremely
  literal port (lots of switches and gotos) is still shipped, as
  "adventure", in the Debian bsdgames package.

  In 1998, Don Knuth rewrote the entire game in CWEB, a literate
  programming language that combines ANSI C and documentation.
  He's updated the program several times since then; most recently
  in January 2010.

  For this translation, my primary source was the "woven" version of
  Knuth's program, circa 2002, as available on literateprogramming.com.
  In cases when the behavior seemed suspect, I compared it to the
  "raw" version of Knuth's current program, and/or to Woods' Fortran
  version. I caught at least two bugs in Knuth2002, both of which had
  been fixed in Knuth2010; so I may have unknowingly copied a few more
  bugs anyway. I may also have introduced a few myself; I've caught one
  such bug already (caused by a mismatched "else").

Both Gillogly's and (especially) Knuth's versions suffer from the
extreme disadvantage that their main() functions are enormous and
convoluted, with gotos jumping all over the place. Knuth's is worse,
because CWEB encourages a subroutine-less style: it's easier to inline
a code snippet than to create a C function call for it.

But even though Knuth's "tangled" C program is indeed a tangled mass of
code (it uses 81 global variables, and the main() function is 3270 lines
long), it's mostly modular in its construction. I've followed Knuth's
organization very closely in my translation.

===========================================================================

A second goal of this translation is to produce a faithful version of
the original "Adventure" which can be compiled to run on the Z-machine.
The history of "Adventure" on the Z-machine, as far as I know, is:

  In May 1994, Graham Nelson ported "Adventure" to Inform 5. His starting
  point was David Baggett's TADS version "Colossal Cave Revisited".
  This version has "EXAMINE" text for all the scenery, and although
  Baggett's version keeps the "motion words" such as SLAB and GRATE,
  Nelson's Inform version gets rid of them. It's easy to distinguish
  this version, because there is no two-word command that will unlock
  the grate. (You must UNLOCK GRATE WITH KEYS.)

  Circa 2010, Chris Conley ported Will Crowther's original ADVENT (that is,
  ADVENT as it was before Don Woods got hold of it) to Inform 7.
  Conley devoted much more effort to fighting the Inform parser, but
  added some convenience commands such as I (as opposed to INVEN).

This C port can be run on the Z-machine if you compile it using
"vbccz", a Z-machine backend written by David Given in 2008 for
Volker Barthelmann's open-source C compiler "vbcc".

However, as of this writing, "vbccz" has some bugs that make the
game runnable but essentially unplayable. I would like to fix these
bugs, eventually, so as to make "Adventure" playable on the Z-machine.

This git repository will host both my port of "Adventure" and my patches
to vbccz.
