<div class="about"><span><p>David Long began writing what was then called
"Adventure 5" while a grad student at the University of Chicago in 1979.
The version playable here extends Crowther and Woods' original game from
15 treasures to 30, and from approximately 130 rooms to approximately 250.</p>

<p>Long's game engine was a strict extension of Crowther and Woods' original
Fortran code, and continued Woods' practice of writing maintainable, copiously
commented source code. However, Long wrote a new English-language parser,
explicitly influenced by "an excellent rival game to Adventure, called DUNGEON,
developed at M.I.T." — the game that eventually became Infocom's famed "Zork"
series. Unlike Crowther's simple two-word parser, Long's parser could deal
with complex commands such as
"<span style="font-variant:small-caps">get brass lamp and put lamp and axe
in leather sack.</span>"</p>

<p>Long released several updates to the game, including a lost 751-point version,
but this particular version's ancestry diverges around 1985. Doug McDonald added
some puzzles (including nine rooms and at least two treasures), ported the entire
game from Fortran&nbsp;IV to Fortran&nbsp;77, and posted it to Usenet in
August 1990.</p>

<p>This particular version of "Adventure 6" was written by Arthur O'Dwyer in C,
following McDonald's Fortran version. Certain spelling errors and <em>many</em>
programming bugs in the original have been fixed, and a single Easter egg
added, but the intent is to be basically faithful to the <em>intended</em>
behavior of the Fortran game.</p></span></div>

<p>This version of "Adventure 6" was created using <a href="http://github.com/Quuxplusone/Advent/">vbccz</a>,
a C compiler for the Z-machine. To play a work like this one, you need an
interpreter program: many are available, among them
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/mac/zoom.html">Zoom for Mac OS X</a> and for
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/unix/zoom/">Unix</a>;
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/davidk.kinder/frotz.html">Windows Frotz</a> or
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/davidk.kinder/glulxe.html">Windows Glulxe</a> for Windows.
Or you can use the Parchment interpreter, without downloading anything, by following the
