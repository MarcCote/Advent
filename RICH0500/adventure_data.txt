  Welcome to Adventure.  Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cavern National
Park, where others have found fame for their explorations and fortune
for the treasures they discovered.  Although it is rumored that some who
enter are never seen again, the Park Service believes the Cavern to be
safe for all ages.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your
eyes and hands.  Direct me with commands of one or two words.  Should
you get stuck, type 'Help' for some general hints.  For information on
how to end your Adventure and other pertinent items, type 'Info'.
+
  I know of directions, actions, and objects.  To move from one place to
another, use compass points or directions like:  East, Down, or Enter.
You may abbreviate compass points and some directions to N, E, NW, etc.
Sometimes, a magic word will move you from one place to another.  If you
know the exact route, you may list a series of directions and I will
follow them.
  I know about many objects.  But please be aware of the difference
between objects and scenery.  To manipulate objects, use some action
word followed by an object.  To pick up a rod, say 'Take rod'.
Sometimes, if you omit the object, I will assume all objects present.
Objects can have side effects.  The rod scares the bird.  Some objects
will change the Cavern if properly used.  The presence of some objects
is required to change the state of other objects.
  Some helpful words are:  If you say 'Look', I will describe to you the
surroundings as fully as possible.  If you say 'Describe object', I will
tell you more about an object.  Say 'Inventory' and I will list what
you're carrying.
  Usually, people having trouble are trying something beyond my
capabilities and should try a completely different tack.  Also, cave
passages turn a lot, and leaving a room to the north doesn't guarantee
you can return to it by going south.
  Good luck!
+
  If you want to end your Adventure, say 'Quit'.   If you're in trouble
and can't find a way out, say 'Resign'.   To see how well you're doing,
say 'Score'.   To save paper, say 'Brief', and I'll tell you the full
description of a room only the first time you get there.  To always get
the full description, say 'Verbose'.   If you can't figure out what to
do, you may ask for a hint by typing 'Hint'.
  To save your game you must first allocate a small 'VB' format data
set, of record length 240, under you user id.  For example, allocate
'xxx.ADVSAV' (where xxx is your user id).  Then call Adventure by
'ADVENT S(ADVSAV)'.  To save your Adventure, answer 'Yes' when quitting
and to restore it say 'Yes' when starting.
  To get full credit for finding a treasure, you must leave it safely in
the Wellhouse.  You do get points for just discovering treasures and
exploring the Cavern.  You lose points for getting killed or resigning.

If you say here the word that is missing in the plaque, you'll
find yourself supprised by what happens.
-10    HINT 5
For your information, serpents hate avian creatures.
-10    HINT 6
This particular dragon is very hard to slay.  I suggest you
hack away at his hide repeatedly.

A crystal bridge would fit perfectly here.  As you can't build
one yourself, I suggest you try an old magician's trick.
-10    HINT 8
A rope could be thrown over the split and it just might catch.
-10    HINT 9
A wooden bridge might be build here if you could find the right
tools and materials.
