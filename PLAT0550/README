The Makefile will invoke f77 (which you can install on Ubuntu
by running "sudo apt-get install fort77") to compile Platt's
"munger", and then run the munger to convert ADVENTURE.ACODE
into a set of four data files. Meanwhile, we compile "exec.f"
into an executable called "adv550". At runtime, the executable
will read in those four data files and use them to construct
the game world.

Platt's Adventure has several differences from Woods',
even in the shared sections. For example, the rough stone
steps don't disappear when you're carrying the gold nugget
(and you can descend them without breaking your neck,
although they remain unclimbable). And the command
GET WATER no longer works to pick up the water bottle.
