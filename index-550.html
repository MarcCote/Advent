<div class="about"><span><p>Adventure 550, also known as "Adventure 3", was
written in 1979 by David Platt. It extends Crowther and Woods' original game
from 15 treasures to 26, and from approximately 130 rooms to approximately 240.
(These impressive numbers are somewhat diminished by the fact that Platt added
three new mazes to the original's two; this accounts for 56 of the new rooms.)
Platt continued to maintain and extend "Adventure 3" for several years after
its initial release, adding new hints and clever messages.</p>

<p>Platt's game engine (the parser and world model) was written in Fortran,
but the game-specific logic and messages were programmed in a special-purpose
language called "A-code", which Platt designed himself. It was the world's
first adventure game description language, and arguably paved the way for
later game description systems such as Infocom's ZIL, the Adventure Game
Toolkit, TADS, and Inform.</p>

<p>This particular version of Adventure was written by Arthur O'Dwyer in C,
following a version of Platt's A-code from 1984. Certain spelling errors
and bugs in the original have been fixed, but otherwise the intent is to
be faithful to the behavior of Platt's game.</p></span></div>

<p>This version of Adventure 550 was created using <a href="http://github.com/Quuxplusone/Advent/">vbccz</a>,
a C compiler for the Z-machine. To play a work like this one, you need an
interpreter program: many are available, among them
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/mac/zoom.html">Zoom for Mac OS X</a> and for
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/unix/zoom/">Unix</a>;
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/davidk.kinder/frotz.html">Windows Frotz</a> or
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/davidk.kinder/glulxe.html">Windows Glulxe</a> for Windows. 
Or you can use the Parchment interpreter, without downloading anything, by following the
