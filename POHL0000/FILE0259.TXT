A classic Dungeons and Dragons text adventure game.  Go into the cave   
and gather as much treasure as possible without getting dismembered,    
eaten or otherwise maimed.  And, of course, escape with your loot!      
                                                                        
Since the C source code is included, the game players can explore       
and the hackers can change things to suit themselves.  Features a good  
English language parser.  Games can be saved in progress and restored   
for later playing.
