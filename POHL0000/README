This is Jerry Pohl's 350-point "Adventure" (dated 12 JUNE 1984),
distributed by PC-SIG with the comment "Author Version: 03/90".
Its version information lists
    
        Conversion to BDS  C by J. R. Jaeger.
        Unix standardization by Jerry D. Pohl.
    
and no other authors, suggesting that it is Pohl's original
(without the later tweaks by Martin Heller, Daimler, et cetera).

Pohl's dwarves don't wander the cave as in the Fortran original.
Instead, the dwarves() function moves each living dwarf to a random
cave location each turn. The effect is similar to PLAT0550's random
dwarf encounters. Furthermore, due to a precedence bug on line 36 of
"turn.c", the player will NEVER see the message "A little dwarf with
a big knife blocks your way!", not even once in a million times.
This bug is carried over into HALL0000; DAIM0000 not only preserves
this bug but adds at least one more similar bug.
