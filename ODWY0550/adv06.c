The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left. Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.

    "There is no charge for the maps;  however, each request MUST include a large (legal-sized or better) self-addressed envelope with at least two first-class stamps.  Requests received without envelopes, or with insufficient return postage, will be tossed into a bottomless pit and never heard from again.\n"
    "\n"
    "The set of maps consists of a two-page map of the main cave, plus detail maps of the mazes, tunnels, and other complex areas. The locations of various treasures and tools are given in the main map... however, the maps do not reveal ways past the cave's obstacles.\n"
    "\n"
    "1/19/82 - Based on many requests, the SAVE/RESTORE logic has been modified in a way that makes exploration of dangerous sections of the cave rather easier.  Three changes are effective:  (1) you need not wait 30 minutes after SAVE'ing a game to RESTORE it;  (2) when you have SAVE'd a game, you will have the chance to continue with your exploration immediately;  (3) when you RESTORE a game, you will have the option to keep the saved game on disk, and can thus RESTORE it an unlimited number of times.\n"
    "\n"
    "A minor bug in the pirate logic has been fixed.\n"
    "\n"
    "10/18/79 - Several problems have been fixed in this version of Adventure.  Both the new run unit and the new database file should be installed at the same time.  (1)  The interpreter trap during \"RESTORE\" operations has been fixed.  (2)  The 'vanishing fog' problem has been corrected.  (3)  If you pour water or oil on the ground, the ground will remain wet (although you can't get the water or oil back by mopping up the floor or any such thing).  (4)  Games saved under previous versions of the database cannot be restored using this version due to some slight changes in the object status controls.\n"

    "Suggestions are being entertained for possible additions to the cave.  If you have any interesting ideas, please write them down and mail them to Dave Platt, c/o Honeywell, 5250 W. Century Blvd, Los Angeles CA 90254, or give me a call at (213)216-6232.\n"

    "I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words like FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, UP, or DOWN.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, \"INVENTORY\" implies \"TAKE INVENTORY\", which causes me to give you a list of the things you're carrying (you can say just \"INV\" instead of \"INVENTORY\" if you wish).  The objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a single word.  For example, \"BUILDING\" usually gets you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south. Good luck!\n"

To re-start your game at a later time, start up a new adventure and after I say \"You are standing...\", you must say \"RESTORE\".  You can also name your game by saying \"SUSPEND mine\" (and \"RESTORE mine\") where \"mine\" is the name that you wish your suspended name to be known by (1-12 characters). To see what hours the cave is normally open, say \"HOURS\". To see how well you're doing, say \"SCORE\".  To get full credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen, it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will affect your score.  To save paper, you may specify \"BRIEF\", which tells me never to repeat the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to by saying \"LOOK\".  If you are an experienced adventurer, you may wish to specify \"FAST\", which is like \"BRIEF\" but more so;  in \"FAST\" mode I will *never* under any circumstances give the full description of a place.  Finally, if you are in \"BRIEF\" or \"FAST\" modes, you may return to the normal mode of operation by saying \"FULL\".\n"

YOU SHOULD USE IT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT, THOUGH, SINCE IT IS A MOST POTENT WORD AND IS PRONE TO BACKFIRE FOR NO OBVIOUS REASON;  ALSO, IT SHOULD NEVER BE USED NEAR WATER OR NEAR ANY SHARP WEAPON OR THE RESULTS MAY BE MOST UNFORTUNATE.  THE WORD IS 'phuggg'\", whispers the djinn, \"AND IT MUST BE PRONOUNCED CAREFULLY IF IT IS TO HAVE THE PROPER EFFECT.  FAREWELL AGAIN, AND GOOD LUCK!\" With that, the djinn-cloud drifts away out of sight.\n"

I'll have to go all the way to Peking for another dragon, and I'll have to convince the Goblin's Union to send me another team of gooseberry goblins; I'll have to sub-contract the building of the volcano out to the local totrugs, and worst of all I'll have to go through eight months of paperwork and red tape to file a new Environmental Impact statement!!

It stands about five feet high on a wheeled metal pedestal, and has a globular light- filled head, accordion-pleated metal arms, and a cylindrical body the size of an oil drum with a plastic panel on the front.  It rolls past without taking any notice of you, all the while waving its arms, flashing a light behind its front panel and bellowing \"WARNING! WARNING!  DANGER!\" at the top of its not inconsiderable voice.  It rolls on out of sight, and moments later there is an immense flash of light and a tremendous blast of sparks and smoke.

    "From the darkness nearby comes the sound of shuffling feet.  As you turn towards the sound, a nine-foot cyclops ambles into the light of your lamp.  The cyclops is dressed in a three-piece suit of worsted wool, and is wearing a black silk top-hat and cowboy boots and is carrying an ebony walking-stick.  It catches sight of you and stops, seeming frozen in its tracks, with its bloodshot eye bulging in amazement and its fang-filled jaw drooping with shock.  After staring at you in incredulous disbelief for a few moments, it reaches into the pocket of its vest and pulls out a small plastic bag filled with a leafy green substance, and examines it carefully.  \"It must be worth eighty pazools an ounce after all\" mumbles the cyclops, who casts one final look at you, shudders, and staggers away out of sight.\n"

    "From somewhere in the distance comes a heart-wrenching scream of mortal terror!  \"NO!  DON'T!  NO!  NO!  HELP!!!!\" cries the voice, and then lets out a wail of agony that is cut off abruptly.  Subdued crunching and slurping sounds can be heard for a minute or so, and then silence falls.\n"
    "\0"
    "From somewhere nearby come the sounds of sliding, stumbling feet. As you turn towards them, the beam of your lamp falls upon a tall, shambling figure approaching you out of the darkness.  Standing no more than five feet tall, it cannot possibly weigh more than fifty pounds including the shroud and bandages in which it is wrapped; a musty reek like the scent of old, dead earth seeps from it and fills the air.  As you cower back in disgust and horror, the figure halts, examines you through eyes resembling wet pebbles, and whispers \"Peace, man!\" in a voice like wind rustling through dead trees.  It then turns and shambles away into the darkness.\n"
